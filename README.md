## Project Overview

YourBuddy is designed to interact with users, ask them questions, and determine their mood based on their responses. The project involves several components:

- User Interface: A user-friendly web interface where users can provide responses to mood-assessment questions.

- Mood Classification: A text classification model that analyzes user responses and categorizes them into predefined mood categories.

- Mood Suggestions: Based on the predicted mood, YourBuddy provides mood-related suggestions or recommendations to improve the user's mood.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run YourBuddy locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourbuddy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd yourbuddy
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the YourBuddy web application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access YourBuddy in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Answer the mood-assessment questions provided by YourBuddy.

4. YourBuddy will analyze your responses and provide mood-related suggestions.

## Data Preprocessing

Before running the application, make sure to preprocess the mood-related data used for mood classification. You can find the data in the `data/mood_data.json` file. The preprocessing steps may include tokenization, lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

## Training the Mood Classifier

The mood classification model used by YourBuddy should be trained on a labeled dataset of mood-related responses. You can provide your own labeled dataset and train the model using suitable machine learning or deep learning techniques.

## Deployment

To deploy YourBuddy to a production environment and make it accessible to users online, you'll need to:

- Host the application on a web server or cloud platform.
- Configure domain and SSL certificates for secure access.
- Set up user authentication if required.
- Continuously monitor and maintain the application for optimal performance.
